# RecGenz Freelancing Platform Development

## Project Overview

We are thrilled to announce the commencement of our freelancing platform development, and we are committed to building a robust, secure, and high-performance system. To achieve these goals, we've carefully selected a technology stack that leverages some of the most reliable and efficient tools available.

### Technology Stack

1. **Backend Development:**
   - **Language: Go (Golang)**
     - Golang is known for its speed, efficiency, and simplicity. It excels in concurrent programming, making it a solid choice for scalable applications. Additionally, Go's strong focus on security is crucial for safeguarding our platform.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - **Language: JavaScript (TypeScript for added type safety)**
     - JavaScript remains a standard for frontend development, and TypeScript enhances code quality by introducing static typing. We've chosen React as our frontend framework for its flexibility and excellent developer experience.

3. **Database:**
   - **PostgreSQL:**
     - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and extensibility. It provides robust support for complex queries and transactions, making it an ideal choice for our freelancing platform.

4. **Version Control:**
   - **Git:**
     - Git is the industry-standard version control system. Its distributed nature and efficiency make it an indispensable tool for collaborative development.

5. **Deployment:**
   - **Docker:**
     - Docker enables containerization, ensuring consistency across various environments. This approach enhances scalability, simplifies deployment, and facilitates efficient resource utilization.

### Design

Anyone around the globe can contribute to this design. Our design, meticulously crafted on Figma, serves as the blueprint for a seamless user experience.
